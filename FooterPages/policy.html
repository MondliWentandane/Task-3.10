    <h1>Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>
            A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process designed to identify and minimize risks associated with the processing of personal data. It's a critical tool for risk negation and demonstrating GDPR compliance.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Benefits of Conducting a DPIA:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ensures GDPR Compliance:</strong> Helps organizations meet their legal obligations and avoid sanctions.</li>
            <li><strong>Builds Public Confidence:</strong> Improves transparency and communication about data protection issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Protects User Rights:</strong> Safeguards individuals from data protection rights violations.</li>
            <li><strong>Enables "Data Protection by Design":</strong> Integrates data privacy features and technologies into project design from the early stages, making protection more effective and cost-efficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Data protection by design:</strong> Embedding privacy from the outset.</li>
            <li><strong>Data protection by default:</strong> Service settings are automatically privacy-friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduces Operational Costs:</strong> Optimizes information flows, eliminating unnecessary data collection and processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduces Organizational Risks:</strong> Proactively addresses data protection risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective Safeguards:</strong> Integrating safeguards early reduces later costs and disruptions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When is a DPIA Mandatory (GDPR)?</h2>
        <p>
            A DPIA is mandatory under GDPR when data processing is "likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons." This is especially relevant for new technologies. Even when not strictly mandatory, conducting a DPIA is considered good practice.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Examples of "High Risk" Processing (requiring a DPIA):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Systematic and Extensive Evaluation/Profiling:</strong> Processing that involves automated evaluation of personal aspects (including profiling) leading to decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects on individuals.
                <br>Examples: Banks screening customers for credit, biotechnology companies offering genetic tests to predict health risks, companies building behavioral marketing profiles.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Large Scale Processing of Special Categories of Data or Criminal Convictions/Offences:</strong> Processing a significant volume of sensitive data or data relating to criminal convictions.
                <br>Examples: A large hospital keeping patient medical records, a private investigator storing offender details. This also includes electronic communication data, location data, or financial data that could increase risk.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Systematic Monitoring of a Publicly Accessible Area on a Large Scale:</strong> Observing, monitoring, or controlling data subjects, especially in public spaces.
                <br>Example: Extensive CCTV surveillance systems in public areas.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Criteria for Assessing High Risk (from Article 29 Working Party):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Evaluation or Scoring:</strong> Profiling and predicting aspects like work performance, economic situation, health, preferences, reliability, behavior, location, or movements.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Decision-Making with Legal or Similar Significant Effect:</strong> Decisions that produce legal effects or significantly affect individuals, potentially leading to exclusion or discrimination.</li>
            <li><strong>Systematic Monitoring:</strong> Observing, monitoring, or controlling data subjects, especially in public areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensitive Data:</strong> Processing special categories of data (Article 9), criminal convictions/offenses data (Article 10), or other data types (like communication, location, financial) that increase risk.
                Even personal or household activity data stored in cloud services can be high-risk if its disclosure would be intrusive.
            </li>
        </ul>
